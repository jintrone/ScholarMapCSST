                <p><b>ScholarMap</b> is intended to enable an overview of our evolving college.  Information
                added by individual faculty and students is added to a shared pool that others reuse to define their own interests.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As data is accumulated, regions of significant overlap (or non-overlap) will become apparent. In the future, we will add
                    more sophisticated visualizations and enable more sophisticated interactions with the data.
